Usage
Upon accessing My Yelp application, users will be required to sign-up/log-in. Once a user is logged in, he/she will be presented with a form where they can enter their desired restaurant details and save them, and a list of already existing restaurants with their details. After submitting the form, the application will display a list of restaurants created and a form to create a new one.
